A misc. collection of interesting TDD resources.

- [How to think about refactoring as a key step in TDD](https://www.planetgeek.ch/2011/08/23/refactoring-in-test-driven-development/)  
- [A nice JS TDD setup](https://medium.com/p/55f59358253f)
- [Mocking is a code smell](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a) - The author suggests that the need for mocking
