"So you should always read standard authors; and when you crave a change, fall back upon those whom you read before." - Seneca the Younger.

In the field of software engineering, these classic and influential books can serve as "standard authors":

- "The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas
- "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma et al.
- "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C. Martin
- "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler
- "Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices" by Robert C. Martin
- "Test-Driven Development: By Example" by Kent Beck

They provide a strong foundation in the field and are still widely read and referenced today.
Reading and studying these books can provide a wealth of knowledge and insight,
and help software engineers continuously improve their skills and grow in their careers.
As Seneca suggests,
periodically returning to these "standard authors" can provide a refreshing change and renewed inspiration.
