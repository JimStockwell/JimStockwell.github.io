## General interesting projects

- Code up, then test, some process coordination algorithms, for example,
  [Peterson's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterson%27s_algorithm).
- Write up my own implementation of String Builder, using an arrayList of string references.
- Write up my own ListArray.
- Review tech literature, looking for something interesting.
  Correspond with authors, a la Dr Tao.
  Blog as well as code up.
- Examples to illustrate design patterns.

## Algorithm and data structures to know better

- For interviews, practice implementing trees and graphs.
- For interviews implementing, not just knowing, binary search.  its a fiddely bit of code.
