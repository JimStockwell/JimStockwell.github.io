What a funny thing,
learning material that you dont expect to use often enough to remember!

It is very useful for bootstrapping at the least.
So learning Spanish, or any other topic,
there is a threshold below which you can't really use the knowledge.
Anki will enable you to get above that threshold.
Also, when you first learn something that is useable,
but not at that moment, Anki can keep it hot for you
until the opportunity arrises to use it enough for memory.
So two kinds of bootstrapping: long term bootstrap and short term.

Scripture memory is a boot strapping example.
If you think about something time and again,
you will keep it in memory.
But you cant think about it easily if it isnt in memory already!

Studying for tests, but not cramming, is another application area.
This is is a sense a thing you ought to think about but might not.

And there are things you ought to think about but might not.
Details of distant friends' lives.
Again, scripture.
Important dates.

Maybe instead of Anki, or in addition,
as you read books, look for as many connections as you can.
This will help keep fresh those things that are relevant.
